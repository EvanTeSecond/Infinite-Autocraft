# Infinite Autocraft
this is a bookmarklet tool to automate crafting in Infinite Craft

# What is a Bookmarklet?
A bookmarklet is a bookmark that contains JavaScript code rather than a URL. This allows users to run a script directly from their bookmarks bar, adding useful functionalities to websites.

# How to Create and Use the Infinite Autocraft Bookmarklet

Create the Bookmarklet:
1. Open a new tab in your browser.
2. Right-click on the bookmarks bar and select "Show bookmarks bar".
3. Right-click the bookmarks bar again and choose "Add page...".
4. Name the bookmark (e.g., "Infinite Autocraft") or leave it blank.
5. In the URL field, paste the Infinite Autocraft JavaScript code (ensure the URL starts with "javascript:").
Note: Verify the javascript: prefix is present by selecting the URL, pressing Ctrl + A, and using the left arrow key to check.
6. Save the bookmark in your preferred folder.

Usage:
1. Visit Infinite Craft.
2. Click on the bookmarklet from your bookmarks bar.
4. Enjoy Infinite Autocraft!
To stop Infinite Autocraft, reload the tab.

# Use at School
If JavaScript bookmarklets or the developer console are blocked on your network, you can use uBlobeBM (created by Blobby Boi) to bypass restrictions. Follow these steps:
1. Follow all the instructions on https://blobby-boi.github.io/uBlobeBM/ to correctly install uBlobeBM, except replace "*##+js(blob.js)" with "*##+js(blob.js, set-constant, CSP_POLICY, null)"
2. Then visit https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/
3. Click CTRL + SHIFT + ` or CTRL + SHIFT + ~
4. Paste the Infinite Autocraft script into the input box (ensure it starts with javascript:, if starting with javascript: won't work, try removing it.)
5. Run it, and your good to go!

If the bookmarklet doesn't work, open the developer console with CTRL + SHIFT + I. Make sure you're under the Console tab. Once you are, type "allow pasting" (If pasting is not allowed) and press Enter. Lastly, paste the Infinite Autocraft script into the console and press Enter
